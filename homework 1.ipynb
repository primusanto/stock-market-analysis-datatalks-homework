    "Question 1: [Index] S&P 500 Stocks Added to the Index\n",
    "Which year had the highest number of additions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia's S&P 500 companies page, download the data including the year each company was added to the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: you can use pandas.read_html to scrape the data into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a DataFrame with company tickers, names, and the year they were added.\n",
    "Extract the year from the addition date and calculate the number of stocks added each year.\n",
    "Which year had the highest number of additions (1957 doesn't count, as it was the year when the S&P 500 index was founded)? Write down this year as your answer (the most recent one, if you have several records).\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Following the announcement, all four new entrants saw their stock prices rise in extended trading on Friday\" - recent examples of S&P 500 additions include DASH, WSM, EXE, TKO in 2025 (Nasdaq article).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: How many current S&P 500 stocks have been in the index for more than 20 years? When stocks are added to the S&P 500, they usually experience a price bump as investors and index funds buy shares following the announcement."
